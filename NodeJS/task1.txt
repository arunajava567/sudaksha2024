Problem Statement:
Create a text file names.txt and add the following data to it.
1.	Oliver,Jack,Harry,Jacob,Charlie,Thomas
2.	 
Now create a JavaScript file user.js and copy paste the below code
1.	const fs = require("fs");
2.	
3.	let logUser = (username) => {
4.	   //Your implementation goes here
5.	};
6.	
7.	logUser("Sam");
8.	 
Whenever a function call happens, you should check whether the username already exists in the text file or not. If exists display a message saying "User already exists". If not, add the user to the text file as a comma separated. After adding the username to the text file, display a success message saying "<<username>> has been added successfully".
Note: Perform case insensitive comparison
 
Sample Input and Expected Output:
Input	Output
Sam	Sam has been added successfully
jack	User already exists
 
Next we will be learn how to modularize the program in a node application.
